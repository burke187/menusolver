MENU PARSE AND SOLVE


You will be given a data file. The first line of the data file will have a target price. The following lines contain a menu of dishes.

Write a program to read in the data file and find any combination of dishes that add up exactly to the target price specified on the first line of the data file. If there is no solution, your program should specify that there is no combination of dishes that will be equal in cost to the target price.

Your program will be tested on multiple data sets so please provide syntax on how to invoke your program with the correct data file. You may use any programming language of your choice. 



Run in terminal in the /lib directory "ruby solver.rb"

This will run the program with the given "menu.txt" file as the input source. This will return a nested array of all the possible combinations that amount to the target price. In this case the possible combinations are either 7 orders of mixed fruit or 2 orders of hot wings, 1 mixed fruit, and a sampler plate. Bon App√©tit!
