=Menu Parse and Solve
You will be given a data file. The first line of the data file will have a target price. The following lines contain a menu of dishes.

Write a program to read in the data file and find any combination of dishes that add up exactly to the target price specified on the first line of the data file. If there is no solution, your program should specify that there is no combination of dishes that will be equal in cost to the target price.

=Run in terminal 
* While in the root folder, execute "ruby run.rb"

This will run the script with the given "menu.txt" file as the input source. Or you can pass in another text file with "ruby run.rb another_file.txt" This will return an array of each possible combinations that amount to the target price.
